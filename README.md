# AI play T rex game based on screenshot, using reinforcement learning.


the bar graph shows the Q value, which show how good it is for the two actions(jump and dont jump) in one particular state/situation. Q value is computed using convolutional neutral network with 4 consecutive screen shot as input. The model is trained by playing 1000 games on its own.
